<p class="left">Whenever people hear of fighting games, they often think of the times when they were younger at the arcade, hanging out with their friends munching on pizza and beating each other up with characters like Ken and Ryu from Street Fighter. How surprised would you be to find out that that&#39;s all changed from merely nights from the arcade and fun Saturday night shindigs to now <b>fully televised, full corporate involvement, watched by millions ordeal!</b></p> 
<figure class="rite">
<img src="hvywght.jpg" alt="hvy">
<figcaption>Starting in 1976, the first real <!--M1LO10unicode here-->&#39;s fighting game&#39;s emerged, <em>heavyweight Champ</em>. Fast forward to the late 80&#39;s s; specifically, 1987-Street Fighter appeared. That really laid the groundwork to what a solid fighting game SHOULD be. The 90&#39;s s was when fighting games really took off-Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Smash Brothers was release-ALL these solid games had sprung up in the 1990&#39;s.</figcaption>

<h3 id="Tournament">TOURNAMENT DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>overall the fighting community has been a grassroots project between wanting to be proven to be better than the other person, a commonality for people to hangout, and in a sense-party! Angelo M. D&#39;s  Argeniolt in his article about <cite>how to join the esports community</cite>:<!--M1LO13C Demonstrate a hyperlink to an external page --></p>
<blockquote><a href="https://www.gamecrate.com/how-e-sports-joining-fighting-game-community/13956#gg"> <!--add quotes-->&quot; An odd but good feeling to be in the fighting game scene: as if professional wrestling, underground pit fighting, and a gigantic party all had a baby and taught it how to wake up shoryuken. &quot;</a></blockquote>
<p class="smsh">To be fair, a lot of that over the top &#39;s salt/trash talk&#39;s that began in the arcades when people gathered has stayed strong over the years, if you ever watch any sort of streaming via Twitch,  You will see a lot of it. In a way it is almost like watching a wrestling match!Usually the more creative you are, the more entertaining the matches can be for the audience.<br/></p> <p class="right">Another important factor towards getting better; at least in the early days of the arcade-if you could back up your talk and had quarters: you stayed. A combination of proving oneself and hanging out with fellow fighter is what starting up a grassroots movement of tournaments. A lot of the major fighting tournaments started out at various people&#39;s s homes, which grew to moving to the local arcade, then lastly gaining attention years later as the FGC continued to grow. An example of this is in the </p><blockquote class="Nin"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX9hbbA-WP4&t=852s">Smash Bros Documentary</a></blockquote><p> where people on the east coast started making their way to the West coast for challenges. Out of this East side meets West side came many tournaments; such as Evolution Fighting Championship, the Capcom Pro Tour and so on.</p>

<h3 id="comm">How to get into the community! </h3>
 <a href="index.html#SoulCalibur">Take a look at some of the expressive displays of fanart!</a>
<p class="1">Find yourself a niche! </p>
<ul class="excite">
<li>You like 2D old school? <br/>We got them!</li>
<li> 3D new school?<br />Sure do!</li>
<li>Mixtures of both? <br />Anime fighting games!?!?</li>
<li>COME AND ENJOY THE FUN!!</li>
</ul>   
<p>Usually the first step in getting involved with the community is finding your niche, and the fun part is: each subcategory of fighter has its own community! Examples are: <br/></p>

<p>From there you practice- A LOT! Online, practice/tutorials, with friends and so forth. From there you move onto going to local tournaments.Local tournaments can be a real make or break deal for people: getting over the nasty hump that is performance nerves! But the biggest thing is to remember and have fun! It is all a learning experience. <br/></p>
<p id="take"><b>The biggest part is always having fun, get out there, and take names!!</b></p>
