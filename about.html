           Reflection: I struggled hard with this homework, More so where to put everything, how to put everything, and even how to attack the homework. </td>
      <td>What I learned is that there are so many ways to go about creating a website it was overwhelming for me. 
           A good portion of my time went to double/triple checking where to put everything, how to put everything where, and so forth. It was a hard learning curve for sure. 
           At the bottom are my sources that I have used. Also for the bottom I split the last 2 articles to properly go side by side.</td>

      <td>the required material, and properly setup my other pages
the hardest part for me was the mobile section and learning how to do flexboxes. Specifically how to make them shrink and grow as needed.</td>
