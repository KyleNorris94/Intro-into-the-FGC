           Here in the about you are breaking the 4th wall-summarizing pages, what you added to pages, what impacts were, layouts how css affected etc. 4-5sentence summary-->
           Reflection: I struggled hard with this homework, More so where to put everything, how to put everything, and even how to attack the homework. </td>
      <td>What I learned is that there are so many ways to go about creating a website it was overwhelming for me. 
           A good portion of my time went to double/triple checking where to put everything, how to put everything where, and so forth. It was a hard learning curve for sure. 
           At the bottom are my sources that I have used. Also for the bottom I split the last 2 articles to properly go side by side.</td>
  
     </tr>
      <tr>
      <th>v2</th>
          <td>Pages added for v2 was the mo37.css because it was needed to help practice early on for the homework. In this version I added: </td>
      <td>the required material, and properly setup my other pages
the hardest part for me was the mobile section and learning how to do flexboxes. Specifically how to make them shrink and grow as needed.</td>
     </tr>
      <tr>
      <th>v3</th>
          <td>What were added: a text box in a form, selection lists in a form, and the use of a submit button in a form from Mod7, M8 I added audio, I had used some music from Amazon.com and using it just for educational purposes. It shall be removed at the end of the quarter. I add some iframes in the about page as well as the mo37 page. </td>
      <td>For the final requirements for Module7-8 I added an animation sequence to the look at the fanart section, making it transition with an ease-in, and ease. Lastly, I had fixed some of the problems from v2 such as inconsistent navigation, letter size, picture scaling and some font readjusting. The hardest part for me was going back to fix what I had missed.  </td>
